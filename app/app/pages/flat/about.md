# Ninhursag


## Introduction

Ninhursag is a visual representation of US Geologic Survey's statistics of
mineral resources and other commodities usage from the start of the 20th
century (year 1900 onwards) using interactive diagrams.

The inspiration comes from the book
["The Limits to Growth"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth)
commissioned by the club of Rome in 1972, and the accompanying computer
programmes. Although the book have had much critique about it's methodology, I
think it's important that people understand where we stand on the
sustainability of natural resources we each use every day.

Other source of inspiration for making this project is that I used to work in
an advertising agency, and back then did some graphic design for some well
known companies, and also designed brochures for one mining equipment
manufacturing company.

That got me thinking, almost nothing comes just from a factory but there is a
lot of machinery, manpower, dynamite, drilling, usually much more than 95
percent of wasted rock from the raw ore, mixed with various chemicals dumped
into the environment before the factory can even start the assembly of a
product. Not to mention transporting the raw materials back and forth the
globe using fossil fuels.

Also of interest is
[Hubbert peak theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubbert_peak_theory)
regarding use of oil in particular.


## Frequently asked questions

### 1. Q: What does the name mean?

- A: In Sumerian mythology,
  [Ninhursag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninhursag) was a mother goddess of
  the mountains, and one of the seven great deities of Sumer. She is
  principally a fertility goddess. Temple hymn sources identify her as the
  'true and great lady of heaven' (possibly in relation to her standing on the
  mountain) and kings of Sumer were 'nourished by Ninhursag's milk'. Her hair
  is sometimes depicted in an omega shape, and she at times wears a horned
  head-dress and tiered skirt, often with bow cases at her shoulders, and not
  infrequently carries a mace or baton surmounted by an omega motif or a
  derivation, sometimes accompanied by a lion cub on a leash. She is the
  tutelary deity to several Sumerian leaders.  According to legend her name
  was changed from Ninmah to Ninhursag by her son Ninurta in order to
  commemorate his creation of the mountains.
