# Ninhursag is visualisation of mineral reserves

The data is from US Geologic Survey and includes data for world
production of all commonly mined minerals starting from year 1900.

You can try to fit various functions to world production data of
the selected mineral by choosing a statistical distribution function.

See the visualisations at:

The app is running on free tier of Heroku, so please be patient as
starting the dyno takes a few seconds!
